/**
 * @file ucdm.h
 * @brief Interface and usage of the Unified Configuration and Data Manager.
 *
 * This library provides the structures and related functions for implementing 
 * a unified configuration and data manager. This design is based on the 
 * MODBUS data model and is intended to interface seamlessly with MODBUS and 
 * derivative protocols. 
 * 
 * UCDM Storage Model
 * ------------------
 * 
 * The basic register type is uint16_t, and the number of configuration 
 * / data registers supported is configurable from within the application.
 * The necessary variables and containers for this purpose need to be defined 
 * within the application. The tentatively recommended location is 
 * `application/main.c`. 
 * 
 * @see UCDM Configuration and Storage Containers
 * 
 * Each register can be configured to set allowed access type to one or more
 * of the following : 
 * - Read-Only Register (always allowed)            (modbus: Input Registers)
 * - Read-Write Register (optional)                 (modbus: Holding Registers)
 * - 16 Read-Only Discrete Bits (always allowed)    (modbus: Input Discrete)
 * - 16 Read-Write Discrete Bits (optional)         (modbus: Coils)
 * 
 * Bit-level Access
 * ----------------
 * 
 * Only basic support of bit read / write is implemented. Bit level access 
 * functions will only operate on normal UCDM registers, ie, registers which
 * are stored directly in UCDM register storage. Specifically :
 *  - Bit read is always allowed, but is useful only for bits in normal UCDM
 *    registers.
 *  - Bit write must be enabled if it is to be used, per register. Bit write
 *    should only be used on normal UCDM registers. Enabling it on registers 
 *    with other write types will cause all manner of undesireable behavior.
 *  
 * @see UCDM Access Type Definitions for Bit Write
 *
 * Register-level Access
 * ---------------------
 * 
 * Register read / write support is more thoroughly supported, allowing a 
 * variety of access types to be used. This implementation of the UCDM treats
 * register read / write as the preferred (and primary) access method.
 * 
 * As in the case of bit read, register read is always allowed. However, 
 * register read can involve one of the following :
 *  - Normal register read, where content of the UCDM storage is returned.
 *  - Pointer register read, where content of the UCDM storage is treated as a 
 *    pointer to where the data is actually stored (equal in size to the 
 *    register),
 *  - Function Pointer register read, where content of the UCDM storage is 
 *    treated as a pointer to a function which, when called with the register 
 *    address, returns the data to be sent back (equal in size to the register).
 *    Such registers MUST be read only registers. 
 * 
 * @see UCDM Access Type Definitions for Register Read
 * 
 * Simlarly, register write allows a variety of write-types. Register write, 
 * though, like bit write, is not allowed by default. Register write must 
 * explicitly be enabled per register, irrespective of what write method is 
 * used. The following write methods are supported : 
 * 
 *  - Normal register write, where content of the UCDM storage is written.
 *  - Pointer register write, where content of the UCDM storage is treated as a 
 *    pointer to where the data should be written (equal in size to the 
 *    register).
 *  - Function Pointer register write, where content of the UCDM storage is 
 *    treated as a pointer to a function which must be called with the data 
 *    to be written (equal in size to the register) and the register address.
 *    Such registers MUST be write only registers. Read will be allowed, but 
 *    unusable. 
 * 
 * @see UCDM Access Type Definitions for Register Write
 * 
 * Post-Write Handlers
 * -------------------
 * 
 * For both register and bit write, UCDM can be configured to execute post-write 
 * handler functions after successful write. These handler functions must be set 
 * per-register, and will be called once per call to ucdm_set_register or 
 * ucdm_set_bit. In the case of register write, all types of writes can trigger 
 * the post-write handler function. Bit-write itself is not allowed for all 
 * registers other than normal ones, and post bit-write handlers are not 
 * applicable for registers with other write types. 
 * 
 * In general, bit write handlers are only called in response to a successful 
 * bit write operation. Register write handlers are called in response to a 
 * successful register write operation, as well as a successful bit write 
 * operation for which a bit write handler is not defined, but a register 
 * write handler is.
 * 
 * Application Notes
 * -----------------
 * 
 * Register Access Types
 * =====================
 * 
 * Configuring the appropriate access type definitions should be done by the
 * application code using the provided functions in this library's API. This
 * configuration is expected to occur during initialization, and not during 
 * normal operation. These functions should therefore not be expected to be 
 * well optimized.
 * 
 * Register access type definitions provided can be used to configure the 
 * appropriate access types as needed, but should be avoided. If you do end
 * up trying to use the included definitions for some reason, though, do so 
 * with care. The provided definitions are readily usable only if the register
 * in question was previously unconfigured. 
 * 
 * Note that in most cases, it will be necessary to set both the read and write 
 * operations on registers to the same type. This must be done by application 
 * code utilizing UCDM. 
 * 
 * Post-Write Handlers
 * ===================
 * 
 * When using post-write handlers, remember that the application code using this
 * handler must also provide the necessary data structures to contain and maintain
 * the handler. The functions provided in this libary's API can help you do this, 
 * but they will not be called automatically here.
 * 
 * Utilizing Function Pointers
 * ===========================
 * 
 * When using function pointers, either with a function read / write type or 
 * as a post-write handler function, remember that these functions will be 
 * called from within the UCDM context. This means that the call stack is 
 * already pretty deep at this point. Further, communication protocols mounted 
 * atop the UCDM which are time-sensitive may not be able to wait for long 
 * running function calls to complete before sending a response. 
 * 
 * The Device Map
 * ==============
 * 
 * The mapping between the register address and function, as well as the 
 * mapping between address and access types, are application specific, and 
 * should be defined in the application. The recommended location is 
 * `application/devicemap.h`
 * 
 * Internal Access
 * ===============
 * 
 * The application should internally just set the appropriate variables within
 * the configuration and data buffer directly. The access exposed to the 
 * interface will always be more restrictive than that the application itself 
 * will require, and considerably more expensive. When they are being accessed 
 * via the UCDM, the functions provided by this library ensure the access is 
 * done correctly. 
 * 
 * @WARNING This approach will break down on platforms where pointer sizes are 
 *          not 16 bit. A means to overcome that problem is necessary.
 * 
 * @see ucdm.c
